//booleans and comparison operators

//booleans
//these have two values true or false



//Comparison operators
/*
< - less than
> - greater than
<= -less than equal to
>= -greater than equal to
= - equal to
*/


//let num1 = 20;
//let num2 = "20";

/*
//  ==  vs ===
console.log(num1==num2);//this returns true if both values are same even if  data type is different
console.log(num1===num2);//this returns false when values are same but data types are different
*/

// != and !== works same as above
