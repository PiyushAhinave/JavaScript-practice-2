//rules for naming variables

//you can not start var name with number
/*
example-
1val is invalid 
val1 is valid 
*/

//you can use only _ or $ symbol 
//first_name - (valid)
/*
var _firstname = "Piyush"
console.log(_firstname);
*/
/*
var $name = "Ahinave";
console.log($name);
above is valid
*/
/*
var n$ame = "Ahinave";
console.log(n$ame);
above is also valid
*/

//you cannot use spaces 
/*
var first name = "Piyush";
console.log(first name);
it gives syntax error
*/

//instead of space we can use _ it is called snake case writing
//var first_name = "Piyush";

//instead of space we can use camel case writing
//var firstName = "Piyush";

//camel case writing and snake case writing are used to read names easily

//convention 
//start with small letter and use camelCase
